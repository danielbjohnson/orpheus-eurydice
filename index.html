            <h1>Are You There, Love?</h1>
            <h2>an Orpheus and Eurydice game</h2>
            <i>And now, retracing his steps, he evaded all mischance, <br>
                and Eurydice, regained, approached the upper air, <br>
                he following behind (since Proserpine had ordained it), <br>
                when a sudden madness seized the incautious lover, <br>
                one to be forgiven, if the spirits knew how to forgive: <br>
                he stopped, and forgetful, alas, on the edge of light, <br>
                his will conquered, he looked back, now, at his Eurydice. <br>
                - Virgil, 29 BCE</i> <br>
